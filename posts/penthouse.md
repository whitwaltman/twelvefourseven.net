title: The nicest room in my brain
---

From time to time, an idea or a half-formed question will just… move in. It picks the nicest room in my brain, sets up a chair by the window, and stays there for weeks or even months. I don’t usually think about it all at once. I tend to orbit it for a while, or it’ll linger in the background while I do other things. Sometimes it drifts so far back in my mind that it’ll seem like I’ve forgotten about it entirely, until *suddenly* it’s back in front of my face, snapping my brain into focus again.

I’ve started calling these “penthouse thoughts”. It’s not a great name, but it works. They’re the thoughts that live in my head rent-free — except instead of crashing on the couch or in a back room, they get the top floor with the good view. (Yes, sort of like that Roman Empire meme, but also not. Penthouse thoughts are less definitive, are more like an unfinished room I keep rearranging every time I pass through.)

A penthouse thought is **stickier** than an ordinary passing thought. You might not realize it at first, but it lurks. It has an edge: a question I can’t quite answer, or an idea that bridges the connection between two things I previously thought unrelated. Over time, it’ll eventually fade or become part of something bigger. But while it’s there, it tends to shape how I notice things.

Lately, the thought that’s been pacing around up there is about language — mainly, the chasm between thinking in one language and translating thoughts into another. It’s something that’s been building slowly, quietly in my head for a while now, but it came into focus recently while I was messing around with numbers.

I’ll occasionally play little games in my head when I'm doing something that doesn't require my full attention. When I walk my dogs, I like to try to anagram street names or find prime numbers in license plates. Recently, I was kayaking and started playing around with converting numbers from base 10 to base 4 and adding them.

At first, it was all back-and-forth: translate here, double-check there, making sure I converted everything properly. But then I noticed I was starting to spot patterns: how certain combinations made sense without needing to mentally switch back to base 10 each time. It still felt pretty clunky, but it was like I had unlocked a part of my brain I didn’t know was there.
