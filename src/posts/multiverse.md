title: Community (2009-2015) and the multiverse
---

I once wrote a paper on the multiverse hypothesis for a course I took in college. No, it wasn't one of those open-ended "write about whatever you want" assignments; it was an exploration paper that was meant to address the question "What is the nature of space and time?".

I should probably note that this was not intended to be a purely technical paper. The class was titled "Science and Science Fiction" and was taught by a professor in the physics department! However, he wasn't overly concerned with us having a rock-solid understanding of these ideas. I was tasked with the following but generally given creative reign in my assignment:

> Briefly describe the difference between a **Level 1** and a **Level 2** multiverse. What is the problem with all multiverse theories, which prevents any of their claims from ever being directly tested or verified?

I'm not going to put the whole paper in here. It's about 5 pages, double-spaced, and I wrote it almost 4 years ago. Instead, I'll paste in a few excerpts and also tie in the *Community* reference because that's probably bugging you by now.

> Many scientists have different theories on the laws and fundamental natures of these alternate universes, as well as where and how they exist. Often, the multiverse is simply defined as the collection of universes that lie beyond our cosmic horizon.

My paper makes reference to two episodes of *Community*, both from the third season of the show: "Geography of Global Conflict" (S3E2) and "Remedial Chaos Theory" (S3E4). The former describes a Level I multiverse, in which two identical Earths reside in parallel dimensions (as opposed to parallel Earths in different galaxies). Within a Level I multiverse, there exists many different universes with different initial distributions of matter, but which operate under the same laws of physics.

The latter episode actually represents a Level III multiverse within Max Tegmark's four-level classification. (I do also define a Level II multiverse in the paper, per my assignment). Level III is akin to the "many-worlds interpretation" of quantum mechanics, which essentially states that whatever can happen, will happen. In the episode, every decision a character makes causes a "splitting" of themselves into different branches in which all other scenarios play out. This leads to the formation of "The Darkest Timeline", a core piece of *Community* lore.
