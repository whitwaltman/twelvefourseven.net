this is mostly just a reminder to myself that i can use `page | dump` on any page that eleventy looks at to generate my site output. it's mostly predictable stuff, but since i'm relatively new to eleventy, i regularly forget when to use `inputPath` vs `fileSlug` vs `filePathStem`

anyways, `page` is one of the [eleventy-supplied data values](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-eleventy-supplied/). it can be accessed directly when you loop through a data collection, e.g.

{% for post in posts %}
    <h3>Here's the post's url: {{ post.url }}</h3>
    <p>{{ post.content | safe }}</p>
{% endfor %}
