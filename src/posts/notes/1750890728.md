programmatically create permalinks in eleventy based on a given pattern

i like to take advantage of eleventy's directory-specific data files feature.

the [docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-template-dir/) include a basic example that shows you how to configure the layout for all the files in a directory via a json file.
