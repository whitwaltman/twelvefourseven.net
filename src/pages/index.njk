    <p>
        The chief trick to making good mistakes is not to hide themâ€” especially not from yourself.
        Instead of turning away in denial when you make a mistake, you should become a connoisseur
        of your own mistakes, turning them over in your mind as if they were works of art, which in
        a way they are.
    </p>
