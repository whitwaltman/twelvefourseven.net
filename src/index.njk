<p>Hi, I'm Whit Waltman.</p>
<p>
... Okay, that's not my actual name.
    But it's one I feel at home in. It's a {% a "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism", "spoonerism" %}
    of the name of {% a "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman", "an American poet" %}.
</p>
<p>
    This is my website. It used to look different. Now it looks like this.
    I suspect it will continue to morph and evolve for as long as it remains on the web.
</p>
<p>
    There'll be more stuff here soon, I hope. For now, you can find me elsewhere on the internet (see below) or you can write to me
    at <code class="text-sm">whitwaltman[at]mailbox[dot]org</code>
</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
