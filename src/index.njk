    Hi, I'm <span class="font-bold">whit waltman</span>. Okay, that's not my actual name.
    But it's one I feel at home in. It's a {% a "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism", "spoonerism" %}
    of the name of {% a "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman", "an American poet" %}.
</p>
<p>
    I've been a fan of puzzles my whole life, and as I've grown older, I've developed a deep fondness for language and wordplay.
    This is a small way for me to pay homage to that, as well as make a subtle nod to my queerness.
</p>
<p>
    This is my website. It used to look different. Now it looks like this.
    I suspect it will continue to morph and evolve for as long as it remains on the web.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not the best writer, and I often struggle to talk about or describe myself, so please forgive the brevity.
    There'll be more stuff here soon, but for now, you can find me elsewhere on the internet (see below) or write to me
    at <code>whitwaltman[at]mailbox[dot]org</code>.

<p>
    Thanks for stopping by.
