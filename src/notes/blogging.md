> Blogging — publicly breaking down the things that seem significant, then synthesizing them in longer pieces — is the defining activity of my days.[^1]

> My composition is greatly aided both 20 years’ worth of mnemonic slurry of semi-remembered posts and the ability to search memex.craphound.com (the site where I’ve mirrored all my Boing Boing posts) easily.

>A huge, searchable database of decades of thought really simplifies the process of synthesis.[^1]

> If I were giving a single piece of advice to any creative starting out, it would be to start noting down everything that grabs your attention, and keep all your notes in one searchable place, as data that you can carry between whatever applications are faddy at the time because two decades is longer than almost any app is maintained, and grow that corpus over time. Don’t presumptively edit, don’t put time into organising, just accrete, and when you make connections, layer them in too, until eventually the whole thing composts down and starts outgassing brand new thoughts of its own.[^2]

> A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox.[^3]

> How do you decide what's worth writing about?
> - would this have helped me a year ago?
> - would this have helped me last week?
> - do i think this would be interesting to at least like 2 other people?[^4]

> There's so much stuff that I'd like to revise or tweak or scratch out—but keep a record of that change of mind for the future. Wouldn't that be so neat? Going back over twenty years of work and watching your thought process adapt over time?[^5]

> A personal blog doesn't have to be just some posts on a page - it can be a game in itself, with milestones and badges for them milestones. That tiny bit of gamification can turn routine writing and site maintenance into a playful (yet capturing) quest.[^6]
---
> That's the purpose of my link blog. It's an ongoing log of things I've found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting.[^7]
---
> The point of that article was to emphasize that blogging doesn't have to be about unique insights. The value is in writing frequently and having something to show for it over time—worthwhile even if you don't attract much of an audience (or any audience at all).[^7]
---
> Our posts are done when you say they are. You do not have to fret about sticking to landing and having a perfect conclusion. Your posts, like this post, are done after we stop writing.[^8]
---
> Once you have everything up and running, resist the temptation to mess around with the styling. Every minute you spend on the look of your blog is another 20 words you could have written.[^8]
