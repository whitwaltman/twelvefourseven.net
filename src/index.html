<p>Hi, I'm Whit Waltman. This is my public notebook.</p>

<p>What does that mean? I don't know yet. But I'm tired of waiting until I have it figured out.
So, this is my attempt <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/12/21/finding-a-form-that-accommodates-the-mess/" target="_blank">
to find a form that accommodates the mess</a>.</p>

<p>Questions? Comments? Fun facts? Send 'em to:
<span style="border: 1px solid var(--lime-400); background-color: var(--lime-100); padding: 0 4px; border-radius: 4px;">
whitwaltman at mailbox dot org</span>.</p>
